Web Development includes Web Application and Web Services ( Web API )

















Understand Web Application:


	It is an application hosted in web server
	Advantage:
Web Application available in the network
Application available round the clock
Client & Server Architecture
No additional software required at client	

Two types of web application:

These application can also called frontend application or UI Application
Developed using UI Technologies like Angular, React, backbone above Node.js


Web API:
          It is a RESTful Web Service
          It is an interoperable source which can interact with database, any application developed using any technology like Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Node and UI Technologies like Angular, React, javascript with ajax call can interact with Web API





How to communicate to database using UI Application like React, Angular, Vue, etc.,?
UI Application cannot interact with database directly, we have to make http call to the web API and Web Api interact with databases

How do react communicate with Web API?
Using following ways react communicate to database via  Web API
    Jquery with ajax call
    window.fetch() method
    axios library


Web Server:
	It is a centralized software used to host web applications and web services
